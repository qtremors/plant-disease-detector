## 📋 To Do

### High Priority
- [ ] **Expand Dataset**: Include more plant types (Tomato, Grape, etc.).
- [ ] **API Access**: Implement REST endpoints for mobile app support.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Dockerization**: Create a Dockerfile for easy deployment.
- [ ] **Inference Optimization**: Switch to TFLite for faster CPU inference.

### Low Priority
- [ ] **PWA Support**: Allow offline viewing of scan history.

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- [ ] **BUG-1:** Large images (8MB+) cause timeout in development server.
  - Implement async processing or resizing on client-side.

---

## 💡 Ideas / Future

- Real-time video stream analysis.
- Integration with plant care advice based on detected disease.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

- Current inference is synchronous; consider Celery if expanding to many concurrent users.
- Model is loaded into memory on the first request; lazy-loading is efficient for low-traffic sites.
